I am the founder of the Monthly Paris Indie Game Dev Meetup. Come and [join them](http://www.meetup.com/Paris-Game-Development-Meetup-Group/), if you are in the area.

The meetup is centered around networking and provides an opportunity for anyone currently working or interested in Indie Game Development to find others to collaborate with, or to discuss games and technology, market trends and issues facing the industry.
